# Crops Time Series Dataset

In this repository, we provide a multivariate time series dataset that consists of the quarterly volume of production of various crops in the Philippines from 2010-2022.

The final version contains 325 crops spread across 83 provinces. At the lowest level (crops crossed with provinces), the dataset consists of 10,949 time series.
